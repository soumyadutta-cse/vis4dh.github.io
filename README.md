## Workshop Theme

Digital Humanities is a research field that aims to bring new insights to the humanities through scientific methodologies centered on computer science and technology. In the current era of big data, the digital data handled by Digital Humanities has become more complex, massive, and multi-source.

In this context, a new trend in Digital Humanities has emerged, aiming to involve a broader range of people from various fields in discussions within the humanities through interdisciplinary research utilizing digital technologies. This trend is known as "Digital and Public Humanities (DPH)." In this interdisciplinary fusion, visualization should play an essential role. Therefore, we are launching a new workshop titled "Workshop on Visualization for the Digital and Public Humanities (DPH-Vis)" as part of PacificVis 2025. This workshop is not just a gathering but a platform that fosters new interdisciplinary collaboration. We welcome researchers from various fields, both in scientific and humanities areas.

Visualization for DPH involves a variety of visualizations: high-quality visualization,
feature-highlighting visualization, AI-assisted visualization, immersive visualization, visualization of digital twins, multi-source/multi-dimensional visualization, time-series visualization, story-telling visualization, and many others. We welcome research contributions to any visualization and visual analytics targeting humanities data.

## Participation/Call for Papers

We invite original, unpublished short papers of up to 6 pages including references. Please note that 6 pages is the length limit, not the expected length.

### Title: Emotion-Driven Talking Face Generation for Digital Humanities

### Abstract:

Emotion-driven talking face generation is a crucial and rapidly developing technology in the field of digital humanities. For example, it can be used to reconstruct the likeness of historical figures, bringing them “to life” to help people better understand history and culture. It can even enable historical figures to engage in multilingual communication, promoting cultural exchange on an international level. Additionally, it can be applied in virtual tour guides, allowing users to customize the likeness of their favorite celebrities as guides. Emotion-driven talking face generation involves transferring facial motion attributes from audio or video onto any portrait image to generate realistic talking face videos. In the domain of representation learning, one of the key challenges for this technology is effectively disentanglement facial expressions and head poses to achieve more natural and precise control in video editing and human-computer interaction. This talk will introduce our recent work for disentanglement speaking motion representations based on prior knowledge, such as the attention disentanglement model, 3DMM model, and Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Additionally, the application of generative models like GAN and NeRF in the task of talking face synthesis will also be discussed. Finally, several digital humanities applications will also be shown.

### Title: High-Visibility Edge-Highlighting Visualization of Large-Scale 3D-Scanned Point Clouds of Cultural Heritage Objects

### Abstract:

The theme of this keynote talk is the visualization of 3D scanned data; a new type of big data produced by modern 3D scanning technology. Recent advances in 3D scanning have made it easier to conduct 3D scans of large-scale cultural heritage objects. The data obtained from these scans result in large-scale point cloud datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of 3D points or even more. In this talk, we will introduce the theory and practice of our method, “dual 3D-edge extraction,” which efficiently and comprehensively extracts 3D edge information from large-scale point cloud data of cultural heritage objects, enabling high-visibility visualization of the complex 3D structures of scanned objects. Our method allows for the accurate extraction and visualization of not only sharp edges but also the soft edges (rounded edges) that are abundant in real cultural heritage objects. Furthermore, the synergy between sharp and soft edges enables halo effects that significantly enhance depth perception. We will present examples of visualizations of highly valuable cultural heritage objects, including the Borobudur Temple (Indonesia), a UNESCO World Heritage site, the festival floats of the Gion Festival (Kyoto, Japan), one of the three largest traditional festivals in Japan, and many others.
